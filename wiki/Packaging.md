# Packaging and Release

## Package generation by CPack
### Introduction to CPack 

cpack can generate native binary package for ubuntu and fedora, even MacOS and Windows.  Windows NSIS packaging is one package generator for cpack, but it is yet tested. Installation by conda for windows would be a better choice for C++ and Python API users.

Inside the build folder, run  `make package` to generate *.deb or *.rpm. 

`cpack`'s configuration (package meta info collection) is located at the bottom of the project toplevel CMakeLists.txt. For each target to install, call the corresponding cmake command `install(target ...)`. 


### packaged files organization

The generated packages is a all-in-one package include all (lib, bin, python module, headers).

For exampel, unzip the deb package file, all installed files are organzied in subfolders 'bin/', 'lib/', 'include/'
- Binaries,  executables
- Headers,  by PUBLIC_HEADER DESTINATION include/Geom
- Library, shared libraries like `libpppGeom.so`
- Python interface module

If system-wide python3 (installed from official repository) is used, which can be confirmed by `which python3`,  this ded/rpm will have the correct python interface module installed.

Note: this fold structure does not work on windows

Headers are not a compiling target, but can be installed eather as files or attached to some compiling target as PUBLIC_HEADER properties.
https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/doc/cpack/Component-Install-With-CPack
```cmake

set_target_properties(MyGeom PROPERTIES 
    PUBLIC_HEADER "${GEOM_HEADERS}")  # must use quote, otherwise only the first one

install(TARGETS MyGeom
  RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
  LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
  PUBLIC_HEADER DESTINATION include/ppp/Geom
  COMPONENT libraries
)
# can be renamed  `RENAME`  `PERMISSIONS`
```
### test data 

it is not decided where to install the test data, therefore, unit test can only run in build folder.

test data, 
test files,

Unit test can be turned off by CMake option `-DPPP_USE_TEST=OFF`


## Python interface module
### python site-package detection

`python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"`

CMake can install all python stuff like utility scripts and extension module`ppp.so/ppp.pyd`, 

```cmake
    execute_process(
        COMMAND "${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE}" -c "if True:
          from distutils import sysconfig as sc
          print(sc.get_python_lib(prefix='', plat_specific=True))"
        OUTPUT_VARIABLE PYTHON_SITE
        OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)
```

 `CPack`  should generate an all-in-one package (deb/rpm) including this python module.  This python module installation route needs more testing for different platform.

`conda` is another choice to support more platforms, by `make install` ppp.so should be installed to conda python' site, while it is not clear on Windows conda. 

### CMake's FindPython has Python_SITELIB, Python_SITEARCH

`Python_SITELIB` is Third-party platform independent installation directory.

Information returned by `distutils.sysconfig.get_python_lib(plat_specific=False,standard_lib=False)`.

```
Python_SITEARCH
```

`Python_SITELIB` is Third-party platform dependent installation directory.

Information returned by `distutils.sysconfig.get_python_lib(plat_specific=True,standard_lib=False)`.

### Generate python interface module `ppp`

The python interface module `ppp` gives API similar with C++, e.g. class `PipelineController`, via pybind11 wrapping C++ API.  It is a not a pure Python module, but C-extension module must be compiled with a specific python version. It means different installer is needed for python 3.6 and python3.7, even if they link to the same c++ shared libraries (libpppGeom.so).

Although cmake has generate python extension "ppp.*.so" on Linux, it targets only one python version detected by cmake. It should be possible to add cmake option to choose python versions, if multiple versions are installed. To specify the python version during cmake configuration.

`-DPython_EXECUTABLE=full_path_to_python`

Extra python interface module can be generated by `setup.py` for another version of Python,  after cmake has successfully compled the all C++ targets such as `pppGeom` shared library.

It is driven by `full_path_to_python setup.py  bdist_wheel` (implemented yet tested). 

Currently, there are 2 hardcoded paths in <../python/setup.py>
It is assumed, the binary building dir is the `build` folder in the repository source dir, (see how the variable `ppp_lib_dir` assigned in setup.py) just as the compiling instruction shown in <CompileOnLinux.md> If a different building dir is used, manually change that variable. 
Another assumption is `occt_include_dir = "/usr/include/opencascade"`, change it if necessary.

### if ppp module is not built, `geomPipeline.py` still works
when `ppp` module is not built/installed,  `geomPipeline.py` will start an external process to run the command `geomPipeline your_config.json`.

`geomPipeline.py` is pure python script, so `geomPipeline your_config.json` works for any version of CPython; the drawback is that c++ class's python wrapping is not available.


## Release

It is expected some binary packages will be generated by CI system on the hosting web.
Tutorial for manuall upload binary as release: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository

### Procedure to make a tagged release

Github workflow CI should generate new binary packages on each git push, that is dev build with version  `0.3-dev`

`git tag  v0.3.0` or branch if necessary in the stable release stage.
`cd build && cmake -DPPP_VERSION_NAME="0.3.0"  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make -j4 && make package`
run the unit test, then manually upload the packages to github Release.

Docker will be used to generate binary package for more platforms

if version increases, edit 
+ `PROJECT_VERSION: "0.3-dev"`  in github workflow CI yml files 
+ PACKAGE_VERSION in project CMakeLists.txt
+ download link in Readme.md

### Generate native packages by CPack in github workflows

It is important to have a meaningful and precise package file name, which is fixed in the project's CMakeLists.txt, 
The package file has the name pattern: `parallel-preprocessor-<this_software_version>-dev_<OS name>-<OS version>.<package_suffix>`.
so later the generated package file can be located and uploaded to release endpoints by CI workflow.

If your OS is not supported, you need to compile it by yourself,  there is documentation for installation dependency and build for all major platforms.

### Upload daily-build packages to Github Release

Official actions `actions/upload-release-asset@v1` does not work for me, so I use "svenstaro/upload-release-action@v2"
First of all, I create release tag, then upload binary package manually (creating file endpoint url by this uploading), to reserve a asset url,
then run this action to update the package on each push. 

```yml
    # those release asset filename (is created mannually before running this action)
    - name: Upload binary package to release
      uses: svenstaro/upload-release-action@v2
      with:
        repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        file: ${{ github.workspace }}/build/${{ env.PROJECT_NAME }}-${{ env.PROJECT_VERSION }}_${{ matrix.os }}.deb
        asset_name: ${{ env.PROJECT_NAME }}-${{ env.PROJECT_VERSION }}_${{ matrix.os }}.deb
        tag: dev
        overwrite: true
        prerelease: true
      if: always()
```

### Binary conda package (under-testing) for all platforms

Conda package building also relies on `install(target ...)` cmake command.

Compiling parallel-preprocessor on windows with dependencies installed by conda-forge, has been confirmed working. Upload to conda-forge is yet configured.

The conda recipe is based on cmake build system. This will install all components (c++ headers, shared-libraries, python interface) to conda's installation directory.


### Container like docker image
Compile and build in docker has been tested, Dockerfile for fedora, centos, ubuntu LTS are available in the sourse repository.

### Deploy on HPC

Centos7 has been tested to compile.  Deployment on HPC without admin privilege is under-investigation. UKAEA HPC has centos 7.x OS.  Singularity image can be a choice for user installation, to maximize the multi-threading or MPI performance.
