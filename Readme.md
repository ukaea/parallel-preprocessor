Dr Andrew Davis of UKAEA, has contributed his technical insight,  test geometries and other support to this software project. Also thank to my colleagues Dr John Nonweiler, Dr Jonathon Shimwell, etc.  for testing and reviewing this software.


[**doxygen generated API documentation with wiki pages**](https://ukaea.github.io/parallel-preprocessor/site/doxygen-docs.html)

## Overview

Although this software aims to be a framework for more CAE/CAE preprocessing operatons, currently, this software provides only multi-threading geometry imprint and collision check, via command line user interface. This software has demonstrated faster and more controllable geometry imprinting on large geometry assemblies (10k+ parts) that is not possible on most existing CAD tools.

Technical backgroud will be added later

## Disclaimer

This is **NOT** a production quality software, but a prototype to demonstrate the potential of accelereating CAE preprocessing by massive-parallel on HPC. We would like to apply more good practice in research software engineering, once resource is available.

## Platforms supported

This project has been designed to be cross-platform, but only Linux is supported as the baseline platform.

+ Ubuntu as the primary/baseline development platform, with deb binary package generated 

+ Fedora, Centos can compile ppp from source, with OpenCascade 7.x source code or copr package.

+ Centos8 should work without much effort; Centos7 software stack is outdated, using docker/singularity instead.

+ Windows 10 users are encouraged to use WSL with one of the supported Linux distributions, while guide to compile on Windows has been added.

+ MacOS should be possible through homebrew, and compiling instruction has been provided.

Conda package and Linux native package for Ubuntu LTS may be available in the future, see [packaging.md](wiki/Packaging.md)

## Installation guide

### Download binary package
Ubuntu deb package and fedora 30+ rpm package, conda packages for windows, it should be available to download on **github Release** for this public github. The unstable package build from the latest code on the main branch can be downloaded here <https://github.com/ukaea/parallel-preprocessor/releases/tag/dev>

**Note: choose the correct operation system, and the package is targeting at system-wide python3**

The package file has the name pattern: `parallel-preprocessor-<this_software_version>-dev_<OS name>-<OS version>.<package_suffix>`
If your OS is not supported, you need to compile it by yourself,  there is documentation for installation dependency and build for all major platforms.

## Future plan

[wiki/Roadmap.md](wiki/Roadmap.md): lists short-term and long-term plan, depends on funding status. Partially sponsoring this project is welcomed to enhance existing modules or develop new modules.

## License consideration
License consideration: LGPL v2.1 instead of LGPL v3, because all relevant projects, OCCT, salome, FreeCAD, are using LGPL v2.1. LGPL v3 and LGPL v2.1 is not fully compatible to mixed up in source code level.
